[{"Name": "Tim Shilling", "Location": "Patuxent River, Maryland", "Headline": "Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer and US Navy Test Pilot", "About": "An Aviator, engineer and maker with a love for all things geek. Flying is fun, there is no doubts about the majesty and wonders that one can have while surfing the clouds. It is one of man\u2019s most beautiful achievements, both unfathomable in its complexities and elegant in its execution. I am a tactically experienced Naval Aviator with nearly 1,500 hours of flight time in over 25 different aircraft; helicopters to jets, bombers to fighters. I am formally trained in the determination of a system\u2019s mission suitability based on its characteristics and behaviors both individually and combined. I have also helped bring to fruition the intrepid Kepler space observatory and the MAGIC Tether, a satellite gravity gradient stabilization deployment system among many others. I have taken a personal interest in deployable embedded training systems to advance our nations readiness and warfighting capabilities. Reaching towards emerging technologies my team and I identified a new display system that was low cost, highly adaptable and easily integrated that leveraged existing infrastructure while offering vast new capabilities. Having been able to prove the validity and identify the potential of this system on three different aircraft on a shoe string budget it has since been picked up by NAVAIR AIRworks. This was done out of love for the cause as an aside to normal duties. I\u2019m known as a man of many skills with a diverse and extensive knowledge base. This comes from years of formal and informal education, experimentation and dabbling in whatever takes my interest. From embedded software and hardware development, to metal work and machining, if it\u2019s different or difficult I pursue it. I have built from scratch my own CNC Router, laser cutter, and 3D Printers utilizing a plethora of skills to include CAD/CAM, programming, machining and electronics design. With these tools I now explore the design of manual and autonomous robotics for both land and airborne platforms.", "Experience": [{"Job Title": "IPT LEAD 4.0M Engineering Analysis", "Company": "Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR)", "Job Dates": "Nov 2017 \u2013 Present", "Job Location": "Patuxent River Md", "Job Description": null}, {"Job Title": "Project Officer and Test Pilot", "Company": "Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 23 (VX-23)", "Job Dates": "Jun 2015 \u2013 Nov 2017", "Job Location": "Patuxent River, Maryland", "Job Description": "Naval Strike Aircraft Test Pilot for EA-6B, EA-18G and F-18E/F aircraft"}, {"Job Title": "Naval Aviator - Test Pilot Under Instruction", "Company": "United States Naval Test Pilot School", "Job Dates": "Mar 2014 \u2013 Jun 2015", "Job Location": "Patuxent River, MD", "Job Description": "Class 147"}, {"Job Title": "Graduate Student", "Company": "Naval Postgraduate School", "Job Dates": "Aug 2012 \u2013 Mar 2014", "Job Location": "Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey Ca", "Job Description": "Masters in Systems Engineering"}, {"Job Title": "Naval Aviator - Junior Officer", "Company": "Electronic Attack Squadron 131 (VAQ-131)", "Job Dates": "Mar 2009 \u2013 Aug 2012", "Job Location": "Oak Harbor WA", "Job Description": "Tactics Deptment Head, Aircraft Division Officer"}, {"Job Title": "Naval Aviator - Student", "Company": "Electronic Attack Squadron 131 (VAQ-131)", "Job Dates": "Jan 2008 \u2013 Mar 2009", "Job Location": "Oak Harbor Wa", "Job Description": null}, {"Job Title": "Student Naval Aviator", "Company": "Electronic Attack Squadron 131 (VAQ-131)", "Job Dates": "Jul 2005 \u2013 Dec 2007", "Job Location": null, "Job Description": "API, VT-2, VT-9"}, {"Job Title": "Associate Engineer", "Company": "Ball Aerospace", "Job Dates": "Mar 2004 \u2013 Jul 2005", "Job Location": "Boulder Co.", "Job Description": "Wire harness design and mass estimation"}, {"Job Title": "Structures and Mechanisms Engineering Team Lead", "Company": "Colorado Space Grant Consortium", "Job Dates": "May 2003 \u2013 Mar 2004", "Job Location": "Boulder Co", "Job Description": "Structures and mechanisms engineering team lead for the Deployment and Intelligent Nanosatellite Operations project"}, {"Job Title": "Machinist and Design Engineer", "Company": "Colorado Space Grant Consortium", "Job Dates": "Aug 2002 \u2013 May 2003", "Job Location": "Boulder Co", "Job Description": "Lead machinist for the production of prototype structures for the Deployment and Intelligent Nanosatellite Operations project"}], "Education": [{"Institution Name": "United States Naval Test Pilot School", "Degree Name": null, "Field of Study": "Aircraft/System Test", "Education Info": "The United States Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS) provides instruction to experienced pilots, flight officers and engineers in the theory, processes and techniques of aircraft and systems test and evaluation.

My experience working in small units as a navy salvage diver, working with the leadership team of the Navy Experimental Diving Unit, and leading a distributed program office of hundreds of government civilians and civilians from the defense industrial base has allowed me to develop broad leadership skills adaptable to any organization.", "Experience": [{"Job Title": "Deputy Chief Technology Officer for Team Submarine", "Company": "US Navy", "Job Dates": "Jul 2019 \u2013 Present", "Job Location": "Washington, D.C.

A BN may be suited to descriptive or predictive application. Descriptive BNs are highly calibrated models that are useful for better understanding the physics and causal relationships driving a system. Predictive BNs are generalisations of a system that have skill at predicting outside of the training domain. The predictive and descriptive usefulness of a BN depends on its complexity and the amount of data available to train it, but there is often a trade-off; higher descriptive skill comes at the cost of reduced predictive skill. To demonstrate the differences between predictive and descriptive BNs in a coastal engineering context, a BN to predict shoreline recession caused by coastal storm events is developed and tested using an extensive 10-year dataset incorporating 137 individual storms events monitored at Narrabeen-Collaroy Beach, Australia. A parsimonious approach to BN development is used to separately determine the optimum predictive and descriptive BNs for this dataset. Results show that for this dataset two quite different BNs can be developed: one that is optimized to achieve the highest predictive skill, and a second network that is optimized to maximize descriptive skill. The optimum predictive BN is found to comprise 3 nodes and can predict the shoreline recession caused by unseen storm events with a skill of 65%. The optimum descriptive BN is composed of 5 nodes and can reproduce 88% of the training set, but with more limited predictive capabilities. The uses and limitations of these two different approaches to BN formulation are illustrated with example applications to coastal process modelling. It is anticipated that the insights provided in this paper will help to clarify the further development of Bayesian Networks applied to coastal modelling."}, {"Publication Title": "Evaluation of video-based linear depth inversion performance and applications using altimeters and hydrographic surveys in a wide range of environmental conditions", "Publication Date": "2018", "Publication Publisher": "Coastal Engineering", "Publication Description": "The performance of a linear depth inversion algorithm, cBathy, applied to coastal video imagery was assessed using observations of water depth from vessel-based hydrographic surveys and in-situ altimeters for a wide range of wave conditions (0.3\u202f<\u202fsignificant wave height\u202f<\u202f4.3\u202fm) on a beah near Duck, North Carolina. Comparisons of video-based cBathy bathymetry with surveyed bathymetry were similar to previous studies (root mean square error (RMSE)\u202f=\u202f0.75\u202fm, bias\u202f=\u202f\u22120.26\u202fm). However, the cross-shore locations of the surfzone sandbar in video-derived bathymetry were biased onshore 18\u201340\u202fm relative to the survey when offshore wave heights exceeded 1.2\u202fm or were greater than half of the bar crest depth, and broke over the sandbar. The onshore bias was 3\u20134\u202fm when wave heights were less than 0.8\u202fm and were not breaking over the sandbar. Comparisons of video-derived seafloor elevations with in-situ altimeter data at three locations onshore of, near, and offshore of the surfzone sandbar over \u223c1 year provide the first assessment of the cBathy technique over a wide range of wave conditions. In the outer surf zone, video-derived results were consistent with long-term patterns of bathymetric change (r2\u202f=\u202f0.64, RMSE\u202f=\u202f0.26\u202fm, bias\u202f=\u202f\u22120.01\u202fm), particularly when wave heights were less than 1.2\u202fm (r2\u202f=\u202f0.83). Near the sandbar, the sign of depth errors depended on the location relative to wave breaking, with video-based depths overestimated (underestimated) offshore (onshore) of wave breaking in the surfzone. Wave speeds estimated by video-based cBathy at the initiation of wave breaking often were twice the speeds predicted by linear theory, and up to three times faster than linear theory during storms. Estimated wave speeds were half as fast as linear theory predictions at the termination of wave breaking shoreward of the sandbar.  However, these results show that during low energy conditions, cBathy estimates could be used to quantify seasonal patterns of seafloor evolution."}, {"Publication Title": "Bayesian hindcast of acoustic transmission loss in the western Pacific Ocean", "Publication Date": "Sep 2016", "Publication Publisher": "Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans", "Publication Description": "A Bayesian network is developed to demonstrate the feasibility of using environmental acoustic feature vectors (EAFVs) to predict underwater acoustic transmission loss (TL) versus range at two locations for a single acoustic source depth and frequency. Features for the networks are chosen based on a sensitivity analysis. The final network design resulted in a well-trained network, with high skill, little gain error, and low bias. The capability presented here shows promise for expansion to a more generalized approach, which could be applied at varying locations, depths and frequencies to estimate acoustic performance over a highly variable oceanographic area in real-time or near-real-time."}, {"Publication Title": "Observations and simulations of wave runup during a laboratory dune erosion experiment", "Publication Date": "Sep 2016", "Publication Publisher": "Coastal Engineering", "Publication Description": "XBeach, a process-based numerical model designed to simulate morphologic change during extreme storm events, was calibrated and compared to observations from a large-scale laboratory dune erosion experiment. Wave conditions along the tan, wave runup at the beach, and 3-dimensional position of the dune were measured throughout the experiment. Seiching modes in the tank were simulated and matched the observations once the model was calibrated. Simulated waves were sensitive to \u03b3, the ratio of wave height to water depth, and cf., the coefficient of friction. Simulated runup explained 50\u201387% of the observed variance in observations. However, the magnitude of simulated wave runup was underestimated throughout the experiment. Errors in simulated runup were composed of a high bias and gain error in mean water level, low bias in the infragravity swash, and low bias and gain errors in incident swash. Observed probability density functions of swash were statistically consistent between times when swash was confined to the foreshore and times when swash interacted with the dune. However, simulated probability density functions of swash were statistically different during the collision regime. Despite the systematic underestimation of wave runup, modeled dune erosion compared well with observations after the sediment transport parameters were calibrated. Modeled dune erosion was sensitive to the critical slope parameters over the wet and dry regions of the beach, the depth of the interface between the wet and dry regions of the beach, and the threshold depth for sediment transport and return flow."}, {"Publication Title": "Video observations of bed form morphodynamics in a meander bend", "Publication Date": "Sep 2015", "Publication Publisher": "Water Resources Research", "Publication Description": null}, {"Publication Title": "Numerical simulation of large dunes in meandering streams and rivers with in-stream rock structures", "Publication Date": "Jul 2015", "Publication Publisher": "Advances in Water Resources", "Publication Description": null}, {"Publication Title": "Probabilistic estimation of dun retreate on the Gold Coast, Australia", "Publication Date": "2014", "Publication Publisher": "Shore & Beach", "Publication Description": null}, {"Publication Title": "Velocity estimation using a bayesian network in a critical-habitat reach of the Kootenai river, ID", "Publication Date": "Jul 2013", "Publication Publisher": "Water Resources Research", "Publication Description": "Numerous numerical modeling studies have been completed in support of an extensive recovery program for the endangered white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) on the Kootenai River near Bonner's Ferry, ID. A technical hurdle in the interpretation of these model results is the transfer of information from the specialist to non-specialist such that practical decisions utilizing the numerical simulations can be made. To address this, we designed and trained a Bayesian network to provide probabilistic prediction of depth-averaged velocity. Prediction of this critical parameter governing suitable spawning habitat was obtained by exploiting the dynamic relationships between variables derived from model simulations with associated parameter uncertainties. Post-design assessment indicates that the most influential environmental variables in order of importance are river discharge, depth, and width, and water surface slope. We demonstrate that the probabilistic network not only reproduces the training data with accuracy similar to the accuracy of a numerical model (root mean squared error of 0.10 m/s), but that it makes reliable predictions on the same river at times and locations other than where the network was trained (root mean squared error of 0.09 m/s). Additionally, the network showed similar skill (root mean square error of 0.04 m/s) when predicting velocity on the Apalachicola River, FL, a river of similar shape and size to the Kootenai River where a related sturgeon population is also threatened."}, {"Publication Title": "Modeling dune response to an East Coast Low", "Publication Date": "Nov 2012", "Publication Publisher": "Marine Geology", "Publication Description": "Coastal dunes can act as a method of soft coastal protection against inundation and direct impact of waves during storms if they are substantially large enough in volume to withstand erosion without breaching. However, the time evolution of sand dunes under direct wave impact is not well understood and many available models require site specific calibration and have had limited verification at field scales. Here we test three models of varying complexity in their ability to predict both dry beach erosion volumes and dune to a retreat for an East Coast Low storm event that occurred on the Gold Coast, Australia. The process-based model, XBeach, which models the entire profile was able to reproduce both dune toe retreat and dry beach volume, however, was sensitive to calibration parameters. The two parametric models that only modeled erosion above the initial dune toe position were capable of accurately predicting dune toe retreat, however, under-estimated dry beach erosion volumes. With no calibration, the parametric model proposed by Palmsten and Holman (2012) produced the smallest errors of dune toe retreat with mean error in final dune position of 6.6 m, or 18% of the total measured dune retreat. With minimal calibration estimated absolute error in average dune toe retreat was less than 13% of observed retreat for all three models."}], "Skills and Endorsements": ["Remote Sensing", "Sediment Transport", "Bayesian statistics", "Statistics", "Research", "Field Work", "Environmental Science", "Numerical Analysis", "Science", "Mathematical Modeling", "Matlab", "Probabilistic Models", "Nearshore", "Rivers", "River"], "URL": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/margaret-palmsten-8454555b"}, {"Name": "Scott Rose", "Location": "Kaneohe, Hawaii", "Headline": "C4I Fleet Requirements", "About": "Experienced Naval Flight Officer with a demonstrated history of working in the military industry.

In addition to the need for low damage, the complex device structures proposed for next generation nanoelectronics will also require control over radical to ion ratio. Electron beam generated plasmas are capable of generating a wide range of charged particle densities (109\u20131012\u2009cm\u22123), while maintaining low electron temperatures (0.1\u20131.0\u2009eV) and in reactive gas backgrounds, a relatively low radical production rate compared to discharges. These characteristics provide the ability to precisely control both the ion energy at adjacent surfaces and the ion to radical flux ratio. The latter capability is realized by coupling an electron beam generated plasma with an auxiliary plasma source designed to promote radical production. In this work, optical emission spectroscopy and Langmuir probe measurements are combined to measure the positive ion and fluorine atom densities in electron beam generated Ar/SF6 plasmas coupled to a remote, inductively coupled plasma source operating in the same environment. The results indicate that the approach can be used to independently control the positive ion and F radical densities such that the ion to radical density ratio can be varied over a range of 2\u20133 orders of magnitude."}, {"Publication Title": "E-beam generated plasma etching for developing high-reflectance mirrors for far-ultraviolet astronomical instrument applications", "Publication Date": "Jul 6, 2018", "Publication Publisher": "SPIE", "Publication Description": "Astronomical space telescopes to study astrophysical phenomena from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the near infrared (NIR) will require mirror coatings with high re\ufb02ectance over this entire spectral region. While coatings for the optical and NIR part of the spectrum are fairly well developed with proven performance, the FUV presents signi\ufb01cant challenges. The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has developed a processing system based on an electron beam-generated plasma that provides for controlled \ufb02uorination and/or etching of surfaces with near monolayer precision and minimal changes to surface morphology. In this paper, we report recent results of samples treated in the NRL Large Area Plasma Processing System (LAPPS) where restoration of the high intrinsic re\ufb02ectance in the FUV spectral range have been observed of aluminum (Al) mirrors protected with a magnesium di-\ufb02uoride (MgF2) overcoat. This paper will also extend these studies to other un-protected Al mirrors protected to demonstrate the capability of LAPPS to simultaneously etch the native oxide layer from bare Al and passivate the surface with \ufb02uorine, leading to marked enhancements in FUV re\ufb02ectance. Laboratory test data and optical diagnostic techniques used to verify surface scattering and durability of selected coatings will be presented. Finally, we will discuss the scalability of the LAPPS etching process in order to realize these high-re\ufb02ectivity coatings on mirror segments as large as those proposed for the Large Ultraviolet, Optical, and Infrared (LUVOIR) astronomical telescope system (1+meter class)."}, {"Publication Title": "Correlating charge fluence with nanoparticle formation during in situ plasma synthesis of nanocomposite films", "Publication Date": "Dec 1, 2017", "Publication Publisher": "PLASMA PROCESSES AND POLYMERS", "Publication Description": "Plasmas enable the fabrication of nanocomposites via in situ reduction of metal precursors dispersed in polymer films.

Unlike conventional discharges produced by electric fields (DC, RF, microwave, etc), the plasma is driven by a high-energy (~few keV) electron beam, an approach that simplifies the relative production of species while providing comparatively high ion-to-radical production rates. The resulting plasmas are characterized by high charged particle densities (1010\u20131011 cm\u22123) and electron temperatures that are typically about 1.0\u2009eV or lower. Accordingly, the flux to adjacent surfaces is generally dominated by ions with kinetic energies in the range of 1\u20135\u2009eV, a value at or near the bond strength of most materials. This provides the potential for controllably engineering materials with monolayer precision, an attribute attractive for the processing of atomically thin material systems.

Parameter variation is used to determine scaling laws, which are otherwise difficult to derive analytically and time consuming to determine empirically. Volume-averaged densities of SF6 dissociation products such as SF x , x = 1...5, F2 and F, as well as electron and ion fluxes on reactor wall are calculated using a one-dimensional steady-state hydrodynamic model. It is established that SF x and F2 have similar trends with the variation of pressure, electron beam current and SF6 concentration, while the scaling of F atoms is markedly different. Attention is paid to the ratio of absorbed neutral-to-ion flux on the reactor wall due to its importance for ion-assisted etching in reactive plasmas. At typical operating conditions, this ratio is between 10 and 103. At very low SF6 concentrations (<1%), F atoms dominate the radical flux to the reactor walls. In contrast, at concentrations above 1%, SF x radicals deliver the most F to the walls."}, {"Publication Title": "Improved Mirror Coatings for use in the Lyman Ultraviolet to Enhance Astronomical Instrument Capabilities", "Publication Date": "Aug 6, 2017", "Publication Publisher": "Proceedings of SPIE", "Publication Description": "This paper will describe efforts at developing broadband mirror coatings with high performance that will extend from infrared wavelengths down to the Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) spectral region. These mirror coatings would be realized by passivating the surface of freshly made aluminum coatings with fluorine ions in order to form a thin AlF3 overcoat that will protect the aluminum from oxidation and, hence, realize the high-reflectance of this material down to its intrinsic cut-off wavelength of 90 nm. Improved reflective coatings for optics, particularly in the FUV region (90-120 nm), could yield dramatically more sensitive instruments and permit more instrument design freedom."}, {"Publication Title": "Three-dimensional model of electron beam generated plasma", "Publication Date": "Jun 1, 2017", "Publication Publisher": "PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY", "Publication Description": "A three-dimensional model for magnetized electron beam generated plasma is described, which includes a coupled fluid simulation of the bulk plasma and a Monte Carlo model for beam electrons. A modified form of the classical expressions for magnetized-plasma electron transport coefficients is used in the fluid plasma model. The plasma model is calibrated and validated using Langmuir probe measurements in a cylindrical electron beam generated plasma, where the beam is launched parallel to the magnetic field. The electron density (ne) and temperature (Te) are measured along and across the beam for several gas pressures and magnetic fields in Ar. The validated plasma model is then used to examine a three-dimensional electron beam generated plasma system. Generally, plasma densities are on the order of 1016 m (3) and, since there is no externally applied electric field in the plasma region, Te is below 1.25 eV in Ar. The chamber in the simulation is slightly asymmetric perpendicular to the axis of the electron beam and the magnetic field. This asymmetry combined with the E x B drift produce non-uniformities in the plasma even if the magnetic field is spatially uniform in the chamber. However, the cross-field plasma uniformity can be controlled by tailoring the magnetic field profile to enhance or reduce plasma production near the periphery of the chamber."}, {"Publication Title": "Plasma-based chemical functionalization of graphene to control the thermal transport at graphene-metal interfaces", "Publication Date": "Mar 25, 2017", "Publication Publisher": "SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY", "Publication Description": "The unique characteristics of graphene have generated much excitement due to its utility across a variety of applications. One of the principal issues inhibiting the development of graphene technologies pertains to difficulties in engineering high-quality metal contacts on graphene. In this regard, the thermal transport at the metal/ graphene interface plays a significant role in the overall performance of devices. Here, we demonstrate the use of electron beam produced plasmas to chemically modify graphene and how these modifications can be used to tune the thermal transport across metal-graphene interfaces. We show that the operating conditions of the plasma can be adjusted to control the character and quantity of chemical moieties at the interface. Typically, when changes in the surface chemistry favor an increase in adhesion between the graphene and metal, the thermal boundary conductance can be notably improved. Interestingly, the conventional approach of adding a titanium \"wetting layer\" to improve metal adhesion did not improve the thermal boundary conductance at gold contacts."}, {"Publication Title": "Electron beam generated plasmas: Characteristics and etching of silicon nitride", "Publication Date": "Jan 25, 2017", "Publication Publisher": "Microelectronic Engineering", "Publication Description": "The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has developed a processing system based on an electron beam-generated plasma, where unlike conventional discharges produced by electric fields (DC, RF, microwave, etc.), ionization is driven by a high-energy (similar to keV) electron beam.

The main plasma parameters, including the maintaining electric field and species densities, are obtained as a function of He-to-air ratio. The results indicate that the concentration of air strongly influences the plasma. Notably, the He metastables and ion densities collapse at air concentrations above 0.1%, while the power required to maintain the plasma sharply increases as the concentration of air exceeds 1%.

In the current study, the evolution and migration of 18 blowouts within Padre Island National Seashore are tracked using aerial photographs and satellite images since 1969. Representative active and stabilized trough blowouts are also examined using ground-penetrating radar surveys and remotely sensed imagery to identify the phases of blowout initiation and stabilization between 1969 and 2010. At least five distinct phases can be identified in the radar surfaces and facies of the active blowout, including both the stabilization and reactivation of the blowout throat, whereas only four phases can be identified in the surfaces and facies of a blowout that completely stabilized in 2010. Results suggest that blowout evolution on Padre Island is episodic and is initiated by the opening and closing of the blowout throat during periods with elevated storm surge. The lack of reflectors at depth is evidence that the development of blowouts on Padre Island is a relatively new phenomenon initiated by overgrazing and maintained by compaction of the beach and backshore by vehicles."}, {"Publication Title": "Public perceptions of a rip current hazard education program: \u2018Break the Grip of the Rip!\u2019", "Publication Date": "2017", "Publication Publisher": "Natural Hazards & Earth System Science", "Publication Description": null}, {"Publication Title": "Case Study of Rip Current Knowledge amongst Students Participating in a Study Abroad Program", "Publication Date": "Nov 28, 2016", "Publication Publisher": "Frontiers: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Study Abroad", "Publication Description": "Study abroad programs are an increasingly promoted part of the university undergraduate curriculum in the United States, intended to provide students with a global perspective and an opportunity to conduct problem-oriented fieldwork that leads to transferable skills in project design, organization, leadership and group dynamics.

This requires that students be informed about the conditions that may affect their safety and well-being while abroad. Improving safety of students abroad and developing effective educational material, therefore, depends on an understanding of student knowledge of rip currents and other beach hazards, and their behavior at foreign beaches, both individually and as part of a group.

Whereas erosion of the beach and dune occurs over hours and days, it can be years to decades before the beach and dune are able to recover to their pre-storm state. As a consequence, there are numerous descriptions of near-instantaneous beach and dune erosion due to storms, the immediate onshore transport of sand, and the initial phases of beach and dune recovery following a storm, but a paucity of data on long-term beach and dune recovery. A combination of previously published data from Galveston Island, Texas and new remotely sensed data from Santa Rosa Island, Florida is used in the present study to quantify the rate of dune recovery for dissipative and intermediate beach types, respectively. Recovery of the dune height and volume on Galveston Island was observed within two years following Hurricane Alicia (1983) and was largely complete within six years of the storm, despite extensive washover. In contrast, the dunes on Santa Rosa Island in Northwest Florida began to recover four years after Hurricane Ivan (2004), and only after the profile approached its pre-storm level and the rate of vegetation recovery (regrowth) was at a maximum. Results show that complete recovery of the largest dunes (in height and volume) will take approximately 10 years on Santa Rosa Island, which suggests that these sections of the island are particularly vulnerable to significant change in island morphology if there is also a change in the frequency and magnitude of storm events.

Control of the spin relaxation in graphene-based structures is necessary to achieve the envisioned utility of graphene in future spintronic devices beyond Moore's law. Proximity induced spin relaxation caused by contact to a high spin-orbit material, such as WS2, offers a promising avenue to manipulate the spin lifetime. We demonstrate the operation of WS2/graphene/fluorographene non-local spin valves and extract the spin lifetimes for a range of carrier concentrations by Hanle effect measurements. Four-terminal charge transport measurements allow us to calculate the momentum relaxation time as a function of carrier concentration and compare it to the spin lifetime. These data show that the D'yakonov-Perel\u2019 mechanism is the dominant spin relaxation mechanism for WS2/graphene/fluorographene devices, while, for reference graphene/fluorographene devices, linear scaling between the spin and momentum lifetimes points to spin-flip scattering during strong elastic scattering events where the scattering event is strongly coupled to the electron spin. We attribute the change in spin relaxation type in part with the inclusion of WS2 as a substrate to proximity induced spin-orbit coupling due to the adjacent WS2 layer, and we compare our data to the literature."}, {"Publication Title": "Large magneto-optical Kerr effect and imaging of magnetic octupole domains in an antiferromagnetic metal", "Publication Date": "Jan 26, 2018", "Publication Publisher": "Nature Photonics", "Publication Description": "Researchers from the University of Tokyo and NIST and NRL in the US have discovered a metallic antiferromagnet (Mn3Sn) that exhibits a large magneto-optic Kerr (MOKE) effect, despite a vanishingly small net magnetization at room temperature."}, {"Publication Title": "Electrical Detection of Charge-to-spin and Spin-to-Charge Conversion in a Topological Insulator Bi 2 Te 3 Using BN/Al 2 O 3 Hybrid Tunnel Barrier", "Publication Date": "2018", "Publication Publisher": "Scientific report", "Publication Description": null}, {"Publication Title": "Spin-Current Generation in Low-Damping Spinel Ferrite,", "Publication Date": "2018", "Publication Publisher": "Physical review applied", "Publication Description": null}, {"Publication Title": "Direct comparison of current-induced spin polarization in topological insulator Bi2Se3 and InAs Rashba states,", "Publication Date": "Nov 17, 2016", "Publication Publisher": "Nature communication", "Publication Description": "Three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) exhibit time-reversal symmetry protected, linearly dispersing Dirac surface states with spin\u2013momentum locking. Band bending at the TI surface may also lead to coexisting trivial two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) states with parabolic energy dispersion. A bias current is expected to generate spin polarization in both systems, although with different magnitude and sign. Here we compare spin potentiometric measurements of bias current-generated spin polarization in Bi2Se3(111) where Dirac surface states coexist with trivial 2DEG states, and in InAs(001) where only trivial 2DEG states are present. We observe spin polarization arising from spin\u2013momentum locking in both cases, with opposite signs of the measured spin voltage. We present a model based on spin dependent electrochemical potentials to directly derive the sign expected for the Dirac surface states, and show that the dominant contribution to the current-generated spin polarization in the TI is from the Dirac surface states."}, {"Publication Title": "Room-Temperature Spin Filtering in Metallic Ferromagnet\u2212Multilayer Graphene\u2212 Ferromagnet Junctions", "Publication Date": "Nov 8, 2016", "Publication Publisher": "ACS nano", "Publication Description": "We report room temperature negative magnetoresistance in ferromagnet-graphene-ferromagnet (FM-Gr-FM) junctions with minority spin polarization exceeding 80%, consistent with predictions of strong minority-spin filtering. We fabricated arrays of such junctions via chemical vapor deposition of graphene on lattice-matched single-crystal NiFe(111) films and standard photolithographic patterning and etching techniques. The junctions exhibit metallic transport behavior, low resistance, and the negative magnetoresistance characteristic of a minority spin filter interface throughout the temperature range 10K to 300K. We develop a device model to incorporate the predicted spin filtering by explicitly treating a metallic minority spin channel and a tunnel barrier majority spin channel, and extract spin polarization of at least 80% in the graphene layer in our structures. The junctions also show anti-ferromagnetic coupling, consistent with several recent predictions. The methods and findings are relevant to fast-readout low-power magnetic random access memory (MRAM) technology, spin logic devices and low-power magnetic field sensors."}], "Skills and Endorsements": ["Thin Films", "Characterization", "Nanotechnology", "Electronics", "Physics", "Scanning Electron Microscopy", "Optics", "Sensors", "Materials Science", "Labview", "Matlab", "Photolithography", "Magnetics", "AFM", "Sputtering", "CVD", "Spin transport"], "URL": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/olaf-van-t-erve-223447b"}, {"Name": "Meredith Donaldson", "Location": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Headline": "US Navy JAG", "About": "J.D. - Marquette University Law School '18", "Experience": [{"Job Title": "Judge Advocate General", "Company": "US Navy", "Job Dates": "Apr 2019 \u2013 Present", "Job Location": null, "Job Description": null}, {"Job Title": "Associate Attorney", "Company": "Laffey, Leitner and Goode LLC", "Job Dates": "Jun 2018 \u2013 Jul 2019", "Job Location": "Greater Milwaukee Area", "Job Description": null}, {"Job Title": "Head Coach Women's Varsity lacrosse", "Company": "Whitefish Bay High School", "Job Dates": "Sep 2014 \u2013 Oct 2018", "Job Location": null, "Job Description": "Coach of the WI National Lacrosse Team (2016, 2018) US Lacrosse National Coach of the Year - WI (2016) Wisconsin Lacrosse Federation Co-Coach of the Year (2015) Coach of the IL/WI National Lacrosse Team (2015)"}, {"Job Title": "Legal Intern", "Company": "Federal US District Court of Eastern Wisconsin", "Job Dates": "Jan 2018 \u2013 May 2018", "Job Location": null, "Job Description": "Drafted decisions on issues related to immigration, EEOC, pro se habeas petitions, insurance fraud, work-product doctrine, the FMLA, forgery, and undue distress Researched and analyzed complex civil litigation issues such as the conflicting circuit court interpretations of pleading common law fraud under Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Prepared bench memoranda and trial binders for Judge Pamela Pepper Screened federal cases and observed trials"}, {"Job Title": "Legal Intern", "Company": "State Public Defender - Appellate Division", "Job Dates": "May 2017 \u2013 Dec 2017", "Job Location": null, "Job Description": "Handled habeas petitions and other post-conviction motions at the appellate and state Supreme Court level Researched precedent for a Chapter 51 case of first impression in front of the Wisconsin Supreme Court Interviewed clients in a prison setting to determine potential appeal issues and hone interviewing skills Spotted issues, examined discovery and analyzed trial transcripts for motion preparation Co-chaired hearings regarding newly discovered evidence and ineffective assistance claims Helped prepare attorneys for oral arguments in front of the State Supreme Court"}, {"Job Title": "Research Assistant and Legal Intern", "Company": "Adams Urfer LLC", "Job Dates": "Sep 2015 \u2013 Dec 2016", "Job Location": "Milwaukee, WI", "Job Description": "Researched and analyzed interactions between drugs to determine whether intoxication was a substantial factor in death for Len Bias cases;
